    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, <br>
         then you've come to the right place. <br>
         Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li> 
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li> 1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.</li>
        <li>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. <br>
            When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. <br>
            Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</li>
        <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. <br>
            It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, <br>
            it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.</li>
        <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. <br>
            Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
