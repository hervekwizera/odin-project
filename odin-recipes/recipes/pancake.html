    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes but i think this worked beatifully.<br>
        we are talking about bacon,cheese,and onions after all,so it wasn't that big of a shock. <br>
        the way the cipotle-spiced maple syrup brought everything together was a risk well rewarded.
