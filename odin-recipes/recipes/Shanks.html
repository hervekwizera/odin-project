    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lamb shanks braised in red wine with fresh rosemary, garlic, and tomatoes. <br>
        Excellent served with polenta or roasted garlic mashed potatoes, <br>
        my family's favorite, to soak up the wonderful sauce. <br>
        This is a fantastic dish to make for company, <br>
        as all the prep work is done at the beginning.  All you have to do is wait.
    </p>

        <li>10 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle red wine</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes with juice</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed chicken broth</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season lamb shanks with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. <br>
            Working in batches, cook shanks until brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. <br>
            Transfer shanks to a plate; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add carrots, onions, and garlic to the pot and saut√© over medium heat until <br>
            golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in wine, tomatoes, <br>
            chicken broth, beef broth, rosemary, and thyme. </li>
        <li>Return shanks to the pot, pressing down to submerge. <br>
            Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. <br>
            Cover and simmer until meat is tender, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li> Remove the lid and simmer to allow flavors to concentrate, about 20 minutes. <br>
             Transfer shanks to a platter; cover with foil to keep warm. <br>
             Continue boiling sauce until thickened, about 15 minutes. <br>
             Spoon sauce over shanks before serving.
